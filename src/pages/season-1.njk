    <p>Things Overheard at the Coffee Bar began the way many rabbit holes do: with a fragment of someone else's conversation that refused to leave our minds.</p>

    <p>Not the hushed reverence of libraries. Not the performative discourse of conference halls. Something in between—where a graduate student explaining neural plasticity sits three feet from a parent troubleshooting their kid's screen addiction. Where someone codes an AI sorting algorithm while overhearing a debate about whether recycling actually works.</p>

    <p>The coffee bar operates as what sociologist Ray Oldenburg called a "third place"—neither home nor work, but the informal public gathering space where community happens accidentally. In an era of algorithmic feeds and curated social media, the coffee bar remains defiantly analog: you can't control who sits next to you, can't mute conversations you disagree with, can't fast-forward through the boring parts.</p>

    <p>This friction, it turns out, might be exactly what we need.</p>

    <h2>The Three Rabbit Holes</h2>
    <p>Nine episodes exploring transformation, embodied knowledge, and what we're losing without knowing we're losing it. We investigate a 42-day Hindu purification practice, test AI for consciousness using metrics we've lost, and ask why kids can't see systems anymore even when they can explain them.</p>

    <p>Each rabbit hole follows the same arc:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Deep research or discovery</strong> — What are we actually dealing with here?</li>
      <li><strong>Where it breaks</strong> — What doesn't work about the standard approach?</li>
      <li><strong>What actually works</strong> — What emerges when you stay with the difficulty?</li>
    </ol>

  <section class="rabbit-hole">
    <h2>Rabbit Hole One: Transformation (The 42-Day Reset)</h2>
    <p class="rabbit-hole-question"><em>What happens when we extract ancient practices from their context?</em></p>

    <p><strong>The Central Question:</strong> Can you transplant transformation? When we take practices developed over millennia in specific cultural contexts and strip them down for Western consumption, what survives? What's lost?</p>

    <p><strong>The Central Question:</strong> If AI can write poetry, diagnose diseases, and pass the Turing test, what's left that's uniquely human? And why does that question feel so urgent now?</p>

    <h2>Rabbit Hole Three: Systems Blindness & The 90s</h2>
    <p class="rabbit-hole-question"><em>Why can't we see systems anymore?</em></p>

    <p><strong>The Central Question:</strong> There was a moment—maybe around 1999—when we could still see how things connected. Then something shifted. What happened?</p>
