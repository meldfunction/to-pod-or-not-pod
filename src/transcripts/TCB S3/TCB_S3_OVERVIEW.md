# SEASON 3: WHEN THE GROUND WON'T STOP SHIFTING
## Things Overheard at the Coffee Bar

---

## SEASON OVERVIEW

**The Opening Line:**
"I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. There's a magnitude 9 earthquake rocking the profession."

We overheard this at a coffee bar in late 2024. The person saying it wasn't panicking—they were trying to make sense of something everyone else seemed to be celebrating. The AI revolution.

What followed was a conversation between tech workers, business owners, and systems thinkers trying to navigate a world where intelligence is becoming abundant. Where the tools change faster than humans can learn them. Where yesterday's expertise becomes tomorrow's commodity.

But instead of finding answers about "which jobs will survive," they stumbled into something deeper: patterns that repeat across every major technology transition in history. Patterns the Amish figured out 200 years ago. Patterns visible in coal consumption during the steam engine revolution. Patterns about how humans actually discover what's valuable when the ground won't stop shifting.

This season follows three rabbit holes that emerged from that conversation.

## THE THREE RABBIT HOLES

### Rabbit Hole One: Discovery & Signals (Episodes 1-3)
**The Question:** How do you see what's needed before it's obvious?

There's the person who becomes the Walmart greeter and the person who creates YouTube videos teaching kids things a dad would. The difference between them isn't intelligence or imagination. It's access to the right signals to chart a coherent path.

But what ARE those signals? How does the YouTube dad see the need for father figure content while millions of others scroll past the same comments? How do you build the capacity to notice opportunities before they're packaged and sold back to you?

This rabbit hole explores the actual mechanics of discovery: embedding in spaces, pattern recognition, cheap experimentation, and why you can't see needs from outside the communities where they exist.

**Episodes:**
- **E01: "The YouTube Dad Problem"** - The discovery question (27 min)
- **E02: "The Amish Method"** - Using mainstream society as beta testers (31 min)  
- **E03: "Boredom as Infrastructure"** - Why you need space to notice (29 min)

### Rabbit Hole Two: Efficiency & Abundance (Episodes 4-6)
**The Question:** What happens when intelligence becomes abundant?

In 1865, James Watt's steam engine improved coal efficiency 8x. British coal consumption didn't fall—it rose 18x. When we made computation cheaper, we didn't reduce computer use. We invented streaming video, cryptocurrency, and AI training. This is Jevons Paradox: efficiency increases consumption.

Now AI is making knowledge work radically more efficient. Aaron Levie argues this won't eliminate jobs—it will explode demand for knowledge work in areas we haven't imagined yet. Every small business will have access to Fortune 500 capabilities. The question isn't "what survives?" but "what becomes valuable when intelligence is abundant?"

This rabbit hole explores the mathematics of rebound effects, the 100x democratization pattern from mainframes to PCs, and why today's jobs become tomorrow's tasks.

**Episodes:**
- **E04: "The Coal Question"** - Jevons Paradox explained (33 min)
- **E05: "The 100x Pattern"** - From mainframes to AI agents (35 min)
- **E06: "When Intelligence Overflows"** - What becomes scarce (32 min)

### Rabbit Hole Three: Collective Resilience (Episodes 7-9)  
**The Question:** How do you navigate phase transitions without losing your mind?

The Amish have survived every technological revolution since the steam engine. Not by rejecting technology, but through collective evaluation. They use a 50-year test cycle. They modify technology to fit values ("Amish hacking"). They ask "what does this do to relationships?" before "what does this let us do?"

Meanwhile, knowledge workers are optimizing individually—trying to master every new AI tool, competing with peers, searching for the perfect AI-proof business idea. This creates the AI blues: permanent anxiety from trying to personally survive a transition that exceeds individual adaptation capacity.

This rabbit hole explores why "you can't do it alone" isn't motivational but mechanical, what value requires participation to exist at all, and how relationships become the only defensible moat when everything else can be automated.

**Episodes:**
- **E07: "You Can't Do It Alone"** - Why collective beats individual (38 min)
- **E08: "Participatory Value"** - The care work insight (36 min)
- **E09: "Building on Shifting Ground"** - What to do Monday (34 min)

## THE PARTICIPANTS

Voices heard across multiple coffee bar conversations, late 2024:

**KARPATHY** - Senior programmer navigating the craft dissolution  
**MAYA** - Business owner wondering what products survive  
**JORDAN** - Systems thinker seeing patterns across transitions  
**ALEX** - 10-person company owner trying to navigate practically  
**LEVIE** - Tech CEO (Aaron Levie) articulating Jevons Paradox for knowledge work  
**ELDER** - Amish community member (composite voice from ethnographic research)  
**SAGE** - Technology ethicist studying long-term patterns

## LISTENING GUIDE

**If you're feeling behind:**  
Start with Rabbit Hole One (Episodes 1-3) on discovery and signals.

**If you're trying to predict which jobs survive:**  
Start with Rabbit Hole Two (Episodes 4-6) on efficiency and abundance.

**If you're anxious and exhausted from trying to keep up:**  
Start with Rabbit Hole Three (Episodes 7-9) on collective resilience.

Or start at S3E01 and let the pattern emerge.

## SEASON ARC

**Act 1 (Episodes 1-3): The Discovery Problem**  
From "I don't know what to do" to "Here's how to see what's needed"

**Act 2 (Episodes 4-6): The Abundance Shift**  
From "AI will eliminate jobs" to "AI will create demand we can't predict"

**Act 3 (Episodes 7-9): The Collective Turn**  
From "How do I personally survive?" to "How do we build together?"

By the end, you won't have predictions about which specific jobs survive. You'll have a framework for navigating transitions when the ground won't stop shifting.

## WHAT'S NEXT

After Season 3, we're exploring: What does it mean to build "practice infrastructure"? How do you create spaces for people to experiment with alternatives while maintaining livelihood? What does cooperative economics look like for knowledge workers?

**Things Overheard at the Coffee Bar** documents conversations happening in third spaces before those spaces disappear. Season 1 explored transformation and embodied knowledge. Season 2 explored personal epistemology. Season 3 explores how to navigate when the ground won't stop shifting.

The conversations are real. The patterns are ancient. The application is urgent.

*Recorded at coffee bars across Richmond, VA and online spaces, late 2024.*
