## THE CONVERSATION

**MAYA:** Okay, so we've talked about discovery—how to see what's needed. But I still don't understand what actually HAPPENS when AI makes knowledge work cheaper. Do jobs disappear or not?

**SAGE:** Let me tell you about coal.

**KARPATHY:** Coal?

**SAGE:** 1865. William Stanley Jevons, British economist, studying coal consumption. James Watt had just invented a steam engine that was 8x more efficient than previous models.

**ALEX:** So coal consumption dropped 8x?

**SAGE:** It rose 18x. To 80 million tons per year. And 6x per capita.

**MAYA:** How is that possible?

**SAGE:** Because the efficiency gains made steam engines economically viable for hundreds of new applications. Textiles, mining, transportation, manufacturing—industries that couldn't justify the old inefficient engines suddenly could afford the new ones.

**JORDAN:** This is Jevons Paradox.

**SAGE:** Exactly. Jevons wrote: "It is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."

**KARPATHY:** So making something more efficient... increases total consumption?

**SAGE:** When the efficiency gains are large enough and the demand is elastic, yes. It's called the rebound effect when consumption increases somewhat. It's called Jevons Paradox specifically when the rebound exceeds 100% of the original efficiency gain.

**LEVIE:** Jevons Paradox is coming to knowledge work.

**MAYA:** Who said that?

**JORDAN:** Aaron Levie. Tech CEO. He wrote a piece about this recently. Let me read you the core claim: "By making it far cheaper to take on any type of task that we can possibly imagine, we're ultimately going to be doing far more."

**ALEX:** So AI makes knowledge work cheaper, which makes us do MORE of it, not less?

**LEVIE:** "The vast majority of AI tokens in the future will be used on things we don't even do today as workers: they will be used on the software projects that wouldn't have been started, the contracts that wouldn't have been reviewed, the medical research that wouldn't have been discovered, and the marketing campaign that wouldn't have been launched otherwise."

**KARPATHY:** That sounds... optimistic. My worry is AI just eliminates my job.

**SAGE:** Let me show you why it's not just optimism. Let me show you the pattern.

## THE MECHANICS

**SAGE:** The rebound effect has three mechanisms. Direct, indirect, and economy-wide.

**Direct rebound:** You get a fuel-efficient car. Driving costs less per mile. So you drive more—take that road trip you wouldn't have taken, visit friends further away. Studies show 10-30% of fuel savings get eaten by increased driving.

**MAYA:** Okay, I can see that.

**SAGE:** Indirect rebound: The money you save on fuel gets spent elsewhere—maybe plane tickets or electronics—which ALSO consume energy. You didn't drive more, but you increased energy use anyway.

**ALEX:** And economy-wide?

**SAGE:** Cheaper fuel makes the entire economy more productive, increasing GDP, which increases resource consumption across all sectors. This is the killer—it's invisible but massive.

**JORDAN:** So for AI and knowledge work, the parallel would be...

**SAGE:** Direct: AI makes a specific task cheaper, so you do more of that task.

Indirect: The money/time you save gets spent on other knowledge work.

Economy-wide: Cheaper knowledge work makes the entire economy more productive, increasing total demand for knowledge work across all sectors.

**KARPATHY:** But this assumes infinite demand for knowledge work. What if there just... aren't more tasks to do?

**LEVIE:** That's the mistake people make. They assume the set of valuable tasks is fixed. It's not.

**JORDAN:** Let me give you historical examples.

## THE 100X PATTERN

**JORDAN:** Here's what happened with computing. Three waves, each roughly 100x the previous wave.

**Mainframes - 1970s:**
- 7,300 units sold in 1979
- Price: $1 million+
- Only Fortune 500 companies could afford
- Total installed base globally: ~88,000 computers
- Applications: batch processing, accounting, payroll

**Minicomputers - 1970s-80s:**
- 81,300 units sold in 1979
- Price: under $100,000 (DEC PDP-8 was $18,000)
- Departments within large companies, mid-size firms
- 100x more units than mainframes
- Applications: process control, scientific research, departmental computing

**Microcomputers/PCs - 1980s:**
- 329,000 units sold in 1979, millions by mid-80s
- Price: $10,000 and falling
- Individual knowledge workers
- 100x more units than minicomputers
- By 1984, PC sales ($11.6B) exceeded mainframe sales ($11.4B) for first time
- Applications: personal productivity, spreadsheets, word processing, desktop publishing

**MAYA:** Each wave was 100x larger in volume and 10x cheaper per unit?

**JORDAN:** Yes. And here's what that ENABLED at each stage—new work that couldn't exist before.

**Mainframe era:** Only Fortune 500 could afford accounting software. Centralized computing departments. Specialized operators required.

**Minicomputer era:** Departments get their own computers. Real-time processing becomes possible. Thousands of companies, not hundreds.

**PC era:** Every knowledge worker gets a computer. Personal productivity software. Desktop publishing. Millions of businesses, not thousands.

**Cloud era:** Every barbershop can afford QuickBooks. CRM, marketing automation for small business. No IT department needed. Billions of users, not millions.

**LEVIE:** "While you would have to have been a Fortune 500 company to access powerful software to do your accounting in the 1970s, by the 2000s with the cloud, it was available to every barbershop in the world."

**ALEX:** So each democratization wave discovered NEW needs that couldn't exist at the previous price point?

**JORDAN:** Exactly. The barbershop owner in 1970 didn't KNOW they needed accounting software because it was economically impossible. Once it became possible, the need became visible.

**SAGE:** That's the Jevons pattern. Efficiency doesn't reduce consumption. It REVEALS latent demand that was suppressed by cost.

## THE MODERN EXAMPLES

**KARPATHY:** But this is historical. What's the evidence this is happening NOW with AI?

**SAGE:** Data centers. Each 1% improvement in computational efficiency has coincided with 0.7% net INCREASE in energy demand.

**MAYA:** Wait, computers got more efficient and we're using MORE energy?

**SAGE:** Much more. We made computation so cheap that we invented: streaming video, AI training, cryptocurrency mining, cloud gaming—none economically viable at old energy costs.

**JORDAN:** Thunder Said Energy studied seven major areas: internet, lighting, material possessions, automotive fuel economy, aviation, air conditioning, residential electricity. The rule of thumb: each 1% efficiency gain = 0.7% increase in consumption.

**ALEX:** So we're not saving energy. We're just finding more uses for it.

**SAGE:** Exactly. And here's the policy nightmare: if you improve efficiency WITHOUT raising the price of the resource, you almost guarantee increased total consumption.

**MAYA:** That's why carbon taxes exist?

**SAGE:** Yes. To prevent the rebound. Make it more efficient AND more expensive, so the price signal counteracts the efficiency gain.

**KARPATHY:** But for AI and knowledge work, there's no "carbon tax" equivalent. AI just keeps getting cheaper.

**LEVIE:** Which is why the rebound will be enormous.

## THE INVESTMENT COST EQUATION

**LEVIE:** "The mistake that people make when thinking about ROI is making the 'R' the core variable, when the real point of leverage is bringing down the cost of 'I'."

**MAYA:** Explain that.

**LEVIE:** Traditional business thinking: maximize return. Better marketing, better sales, better features. But the CONSTRAINT isn't return—it's investment cost.

**ALEX:** Give me a concrete example.

**LEVIE:** "Every entrepreneur, business owner, or anyone involved in a budget planning process knows how scarce resources are when running a business. When you're a small team, you're making decisions between having a good marketing webpage, building a new product experience, handling customer support inquiries, taking care of something important in finance, finding new distribution. Every one of these areas of investment and time are trading off from one another."

**MAYA:** That's my entire life. We're constantly triaging.

**ALEX:** And it's not about which has better ROI. It's about which we can AFFORD to try.

**LEVIE:** "Now, we have the ability to blow up the core constraint driving many of these tradeoffs: the cost of doing these activities."

**JORDAN:** Let me break down the investment cost components.

**Traditional knowledge work investment has three costs:**

**1. Expertise acquisition cost**
- Hiring: recruiting, interviewing, onboarding ($30K+)
- Training: ramp-up time, mistakes during learning (3-6 months @ 50% productivity)
- Retention: ongoing management, benefits, culture fit
- Total: $100K+ before productive output

**2. Execution cost**
- Labor hours × hourly rate
- Tools and infrastructure
- Coordination overhead (meetings, alignment, communication)
- Context switching penalties

**3. Risk cost**
- What if project fails? (sunk cost)
- What if person leaves mid-project? (restart cost)
- What if we built wrong thing? (pivot cost)

**ALEX:** And AI collapses all three?

**MAYA:** Let me test this with my company. Customer success dashboard.

**Human development:**
- Hire developer: $160K/year fully loaded
- Ramp-up: 3 months @ 50% productivity
- Development: 6 months
- Total cost: ~$100K for project
- Risk: High (developer leaves? wrong approach?)

**AI-assisted development:**
- Existing developer + AI coding assistant
- Ramp-up: immediate (AI knows our codebase)
- Development: 3 weeks
- Total cost: ~$6K
- Risk: Low (iterate quickly, developer stays)

**ALEX:** That's a 15x reduction in cost of "I".

**SAGE:** And when investment cost drops 15x, what becomes economically viable?

**MAYA:** Everything we WEREN'T doing because it had negative ROI at old costs.

## THE PORTFOLIO EFFECT

**JORDAN:** Here's the math. Traditional model:

You have $100K annual budget for experiments.
Each human-led experiment costs $20K.
You can try 5 things.
Success rate: 20%
You get 1 success per year.

**AI-assisted model:**

Same $100K budget.
Each AI-assisted experiment costs $2K.
You can try 50 things.
Success rate: 15% (lower because you're trying riskier things)
You get 7.5 successes per year.

**KARPATHY:** So even with a LOWER success rate per experiment, you get more total successes because you can afford more experiments?

**JORDAN:** Yes. This is portfolio theory. When individual trials are cheap, you can afford to have a lower hit rate.

**LEVIE:** "Demand will go up 10X or 100X for many areas of work because we've lowered the barriers to entry of doing many more types of work that most companies wouldn't have even experimented with before."

**ALEX:** And the things we're trying are things we WOULDN'T HAVE TRIED before.

**SAGE:** That's the latent demand being revealed. The barbershop that couldn't afford custom software in 1970 didn't know it needed it. Once it became affordable, the need became visible.

**MAYA:** So the question isn't "what work survives AI?" but "what NEW work becomes possible?"

**LEVIE:** Exactly. "The vast majority of AI tokens in the future will be used on things we don't even do today."

## THE SKEPTICAL OBJECTION

**KARPATHY:** But this still sounds like job elimination to me. If we can do 10x more with AI, don't we need 10x fewer workers?

**JORDAN:** Let me give you the historical counter-example. Marketing.

**LEVIE:** "Back of the envelope math suggests that there were a few hundred thousand people employed across marketing related job categories in the 1970s in the US; today, it's in the low millions. How did we experience a 5X+ increase in these jobs at the exact same time that technology made this work far more efficient?"

**KARPATHY:** How?

**JORDAN:** Let me unpack this.

**Marketing in 1970s:**
- Manual typesetting, hand-drawn illustrations
- Physical photography, darkroom development
- Print-only advertising (newspapers, magazines, billboards)
- Mass market targeting only (crude demographics)
- Cost per campaign: $50K-$500K minimum
- Accessible only to large companies (CPG, automotive)
- Few hundred thousand employed

**Marketing today:**
- Digital design tools (Figma, AI image generation)
- Programmatic ad buying, micro-targeting
- Multi-channel (social, search, display, video, podcast, influencer)
- Cost per campaign: $500-$5K possible
- Accessible to any small business
- Low millions employed

**SAGE:** We made each individual marketing task VASTLY more efficient. Design, targeting, placement, measurement. This should have reduced marketing jobs, right?

**ALEX:** But instead, we expanded the market for marketing services by 100x.

**JORDAN:** Every small business can now justify a marketing budget. Every niche product can find its audience. Every local service can run targeted ads.

**LEVIE:** "Actually precisely because of those efficiencies. We went from advertising being the domain only of the largest companies to something that almost any small business could participate in. The marketing technology, CRM systems, analytics, graphic design software, targeting platforms allowed more companies to justify the ROI of doing more sophisticated marketing."

**MAYA:** This is Jevons Paradox for knowledge work.

**SAGE:** Yes. The efficiency gains democratized access, which expanded total demand beyond original reductions.

## TODAY'S JOBS BECOME TOMORROW'S TASKS

**KARPATHY:** So my job isn't disappearing. It's... changing?

**LEVIE:** "It's clear that AI agents are successfully taking over various tasks (like researching a market, writing code for a new feature), but incorporating those tasks into a broader workflow to produce value still requires human judgment and a ton of effort."

**JORDAN:** Here's the pattern: Today's jobs become tomorrow's tasks.

**Examples:**

"Graphic designer" (1970s job) → "design this ad" (today's task within marketing role)

"Typesetter" (1950s job) → "format this document" (today's task within any role)

"Data entry clerk" (1980s job) → "upload this spreadsheet" (today's task within analyst role)

"Junior programmer" (2020s job) → "implement this feature" (2030s task within product role?)

**SAGE:** The WORK doesn't disappear. It becomes a smaller component of a larger role.

**MAYA:** So instead of hiring a junior developer to implement features, I hire a product person who uses AI to implement features as part of their broader role?

**JORDAN:** Probably. The "implementing features" work still happens. It just becomes one task among many that the product person does.

**KARPATHY:** So I need to expand what I do beyond just coding?

**LEVIE:** "Ultimately ensuring that today's jobs are tomorrow's tasks. Historically, this actually happens all the time. If you told someone about Figma or Google Adwords in the 1970s they'd have expected marketing jobs to plummet since we could do many different jobs inside of a single role in the future; well, the opposite has happened."

**ALEX:** Because the total AMOUNT of marketing work exploded, even though each individual could do more types of marketing work?

**SAGE:** Exactly. Jevons Paradox.

## THE UNCOMFORTABLE IMPLICATION

**MAYA:** Okay, I'm starting to see it. But there's something uncomfortable here.

**JORDAN:** What?

**MAYA:** If efficiency creates abundance, and abundance reveals latent demand, then... we're going to be working MORE, not less?

**SAGE:** Not necessarily more HOURS. But yes, more TYPES of work. More experiments. More attempts. More iteration.

**KARPATHY:** The "AI will free us from work" narrative is backwards?

**LEVIE:** "Of course, many are wondering what happens to all the jobs in this new world? The reality is that despite all the tasks that AI lets us automate, it still requires people to pull together the full workflow to produce real value. AI agents require management, oversight, and substantial context to get the full gains."

**ALEX:** So we become orchestrators, not executors?

**JORDAN:** Probably. You're not writing code yourself. You're orchestrating AI to write code. You're not designing graphics yourself. You're orchestrating AI to design graphics. But the orchestration itself is knowledge work.

**MAYA:** And there will be MORE orchestration work than there was execution work?

**SAGE:** If the pattern holds, yes. Because orchestration is cheaper than execution, so more projects become viable.

**KARPATHY:** This is exhausting just thinking about it.

**JORDAN:** Welcome to abundance.

## THE QUESTION THAT REMAINS

**ALEX:** So if Jevons Paradox means AI will create MORE total knowledge work, not less... what determines who captures that work?

**MAYA:** That's the YouTube dad versus Walmart greeter question again.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. The work exists. The question is: who sees it? Who positions themselves to do it? Who builds the capacity to navigate abundance?

**SAGE:** Which brings us back to Rabbit Hole One. Discovery, signals, the Amish method, boredom as infrastructure.

**LEVIE:** "The vast majority of AI tokens in the future will be used on things we don't even do today as workers."

**KARPATHY:** Things we haven't imagined yet.

**MAYA:** Things that couldn't exist at old costs.

**ALEX:** Things that require discovery, not prediction.

**JORDAN:** And that's why this matters. You can't predict what specific work will be valuable. But you can understand the PATTERN.

**Efficiency → Abundance → Latent demand revealed → Total consumption increases**

**SAGE:** When coal became efficient, no one predicted all the applications steam engines would enable.

When computation became cheap, no one predicted streaming video or cryptocurrency.

When knowledge work becomes cheap via AI, we can't predict what new applications will emerge.

**MAYA:** But we can know that SOMETHING will emerge.

**JORDAN:** Yes. And we can position ourselves to discover it.

**Next episode:** We'll explore the 100x pattern in more detail. How each democratization wave—mainframes to minis to PCs to cloud to AI—follows the same expansion pattern. And what that tells us about where we're headed.
