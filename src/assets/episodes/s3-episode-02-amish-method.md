# S3 E02: THE AMISH METHOD
## Things Overheard at the Coffee Bar - Season 3

**Runtime:** 31 minutes  
**Rabbit Hole:** Discovery & Signals (2 of 3)  
**Recorded:** Late 2024, coffee bars in Richmond, VA

## EPISODE DESCRIPTION

"We use mainstream society as beta testers."

Last episode, we explored how the YouTube dad discovered what was needed by embedding in spaces, following adjacent pain, running cheap experiments, and having space to notice. But there's a community that's been perfecting this process for 200 years.

The Amish don't reject technology. They evaluate it collectively using a 50-year test cycle. They watch YOU adopt smartphones, observe what happens to your families and communities, then decide whether to adopt themselves.

They ask one question before adopting any technology: "What does this do to how we relate?"

This episode explores what happens when you flip the script on technological disruption—when you're strategic about being "behind" and use everyone else's FOMO as free market research.

**Content Warning:** Discusses technology adoption, mental health impacts of social media, and questioning mainstream assumptions about progress.

## COLD OPEN

*[Sounds of coffee bar, conversation in progress]*

**VOICE 1 (ALEX):** Wait, so the Amish KNOW about smartphones? They're not just... oblivious to modern technology?

**VOICE 2 (ELDER):** We know about everything. We just don't adopt everything.

**VOICE 3 (JORDAN):** Tell them about the phone shanties.

**ELDER:** *[chuckles]* We allow phones. But they have to be in a building 300 meters from your house. You can use them for business. But they don't interrupt family dinner.

**ALEX:** That's... strategic.

**ELDER:** We've been doing this for 200 years. You experiment with everything. We watch what breaks. Then we decide.

*[Beat]*

**ELDER:** You know how many Amish teenagers struggled with depression from social media?

**ALEX:** How many?

**ELDER:** Zero. We watched it happen to your kids first.

*[Music: spare, thoughtful]*

**NARRATOR:** This is Things Overheard at the Coffee Bar. Season Three: When the Ground Won't Stop Shifting.

Last episode, we explored how to discover what's needed before it's obvious. This episode: what happens when you don't rush to adopt, and instead use everyone else as your research subjects.

This is Episode 2: The Amish Method.

*[Music swells, then fades]*

## ACT 1: THE 50-YEAR TEST CYCLE

*[Music fades. Coffee bar ambience returns.]*

**NARRATOR:** Before we continue that conversation, let me give you context.

The voice you just heard—we're calling them Elder—represents composite research from ethnographic studies of Amish technology evaluation. Dr. Jameson Wetmore at Arizona State, Donald Kraybill's extensive work, multiple field studies.

The Amish aren't technophobes. They're the most sophisticated technology adopters in America.

Here's how it actually works.

*[Transition to Elder explaining]*

**ELDER:** When new technology appears—let's say smartphones in 2007—we don't ask individuals "should you get one?" We ask collectively: "what does this do to how we relate?"

**ALEX:** How do you answer that without trying it?

**ELDER:** We DO try it. Just not all at once. Some members will adopt early. We watch. Not for six months—for YEARS. Document what changes in their families, their work, their relationships.

**JORDAN:** You're running controlled experiments.

**ELDER:** Exactly. But the control group is most of the community. The experimental group is the early adopters. And the observation period is decades.

**ALEX:** That's insane. You're 50 years behind!

**ELDER:** We're not behind. We're strategic. Being "behind" means we see what technology actually DOES, not what it PROMISES to do.

*[Music: contemplative]*

**NARRATOR:** Let's pause here. Because Elder just flipped the entire framing.

Most of us think of the Amish as "behind" or "primitive" or "stuck in the past." But from their perspective, they're doing rigorous long-term research while mainstream society acts as unpaid beta testers.

Think about that. Every time you adopt new technology without waiting to see long-term effects, you're participating in a free market research study. The Amish are watching.

When social media launched, they watched. When smartphones became ubiquitous, they watched. When screens started dominating childhood, they watched.

Then in 2015, when the data started showing teen depression rising, attention spans declining, face-to-face communication decreasing—they had a decision point based on actual evidence, not marketing promises.

Let's go back.

## INTERLUDE 1: THE ACTUAL PROCESS

**NARRATOR:** Elder just outlined the Amish method. Let me break down the actual steps:

**Step 1: Early Adopters Test**
- When new technology appears, some community members try it
- This isn't random—often it's people whose work requires it
- Example: A businessman might need a phone for orders
- Community observes effects over YEARS, not months

**Step 2: Community Discussion**
- Bishop raises the question in congregation
- Everyone discusses what they've observed
- Not "is this good or bad" in abstract
- But "what did this actually DO to the people who adopted it?"
- Focus on second-order effects: family dynamics, community cohesion, relationship quality

**Step 3: Collective Decision**
- Congregational vote—all affected parties have voice
- Decision becomes part of the Ordnung (community rules)
- Everyone abides by collective decision
- Not individual choice, but communal wisdom

**Step 4: Modification ("Amish Hacking")**
- If technology is adopted, modify to fit values
- Example: Pneumatic tools yes, electric tools no (same function, different infrastructure dependency)
- Example: Phones in shanties 300m from house (business yes, family interruption no)
- Example: Solar panels yes, connection to grid no (energy independence maintained)

This isn't rejection. It's intentional adoption based on demonstrated fit with values.

## ACT 2: WHAT DOES THIS DO TO HOW WE RELATE?

*[Coffee bar sounds return]*

**ALEX:** Okay but how do you decide what "fits values"? That seems arbitrary.

**ELDER:** It's not arbitrary. We have one primary question: What does this technology do to how we relate to each other?

**JORDAN:** Not "what does this let us do?"

**ELDER:** Correct. Mainstream asks: "What new capabilities does this enable?" We ask: "What does this do to family bonds? To community connection? To our relationship with work, with land, with each other?"

**ALEX:** Give me an example.

**ELDER:** Cars. We don't drive cars. We use horse and buggy.

**ALEX:** Right, because... you're traditional?

**ELDER:** No. Because cars change community boundaries. With a horse and buggy, your community is defined by how far you can travel in a day and still return home. About a 20-mile radius. This creates density. You know your neighbors. You participate in their lives. They participate in yours.

With cars, your "community" becomes wherever you feel like driving. You can live 50 miles from your church and still attend. This spreads people out. Weakens local bonds. Makes it easier to avoid difficult relationships instead of working through them.

**JORDAN:** So the technology itself reshapes social structure.

**ELDER:** Always. Technology is never neutral. It always does something to how people relate.

**ALEX:** But you DO use technology. You're not anti-technology.

**ELDER:** We use washing machines, refrigerators, power tools, solar panels, even computers for business in some communities. We just modify them to preserve what we value.

*[Beat]*

**ELDER:** Your problem is you adopt everything by default and wonder why your relationships are degrading. We adopt selectively and maintain relationships.

*[Music: slightly tense]*

**NARRATOR:** This is the uncomfortable part. Elder just diagnosed the mainstream approach: adopt by default, fix problems later.

We got smartphones before asking what they'd do to attention.  
We got social media before asking what it'd do to self-worth.  
We got always-on connectivity before asking what it'd do to presence.

Now we're scrambling to fix addiction, depression, fragmented attention—problems the Amish saw coming because they were watching.

But here's what's relevant for AI disruption: What if we applied the Amish method to AI adoption?

---

## ACT 3: APPLYING THE METHOD TO AI

*[Transition to different part of conversation]*

**JORDAN:** So how would the Amish method apply to AI?

**ELDER:** Same process. Don't rush to adopt. Watch what happens to early adopters. Ask: what does this do to how people relate?

**ALEX:** But AI is different. It's moving faster. I can't wait 50 years.

**ELDER:** You don't need 50 years. You need patience. Three years. Five years. Long enough to see what actually happens versus what's promised.

**JORDAN:** What would you be watching for?

**ELDER:** Same things we always watch. Does this make people more dependent on systems they don't control? Does this weaken skills they used to have? Does this change how they value human relationships?

**ALEX:** Those are all happening.

**ELDER:** Then you have data. Now the question is: do you modify how you adopt? Do you create boundaries like we do with phone shanties? Or do you just... let it happen?

**JORDAN:** What would AI "phone shanties" look like?

**ELDER:** *[pauses]* That's for you to discover. We create boundaries based on our values. You need to know what YOU value first.

*[Long pause]*

**ALEX:** We don't know.

**ELDER:** That's the problem.

*[Music: recognition]*

**NARRATOR:** This is the insight. The Amish method works because they know what they value: family cohesion, community bonds, face-to-face relationships, skilled work, connection to land.

When new technology appears, they can evaluate it against those values. Does it strengthen them or weaken them?

But most knowledge workers don't have clear values. We optimize for... productivity? Income? Status? Career advancement? The values shift depending on context.

Without clear values, you can't evaluate technology. You just adopt whatever seems useful and deal with consequences later.

The Amish method isn't just about waiting. It's about knowing what you're protecting.

---

## INTERLUDE 2: THE TEEN DEPRESSION CASE STUDY

**NARRATOR:** Let me give you a concrete example of the Amish method working.

**2007:** iPhone launches. Social media goes mobile.

**2007-2012:** Mainstream adoption. Parents give kids smartphones. Social media becomes ubiquitous for teens.

**2012-2015:** Early warning signs. Research starts showing increased anxiety, depression, sleep disruption in teens. But it's dismissed as correlation, not causation.

**2015-2018:** Mental health crisis becomes undeniable. Teen depression rates double. Suicide rates increase 56% for teenage girls. Jonathan Haidt and Jean Twenge document the crisis.

**2018:** Many Amish communities vote: no smartphones for members under 25.

They avoided the ENTIRE crisis. Not because they predicted it. Because they WATCHED it happen to mainstream kids first.

This is the power of the 50-year test cycle. You don't need to predict second-order effects. You just need to wait long enough to observe them.

Now think about AI.

**2022:** ChatGPT launches. AI goes mainstream.

**2022-2024:** Rapid adoption. Companies race to implement AI. Knowledge workers scramble to learn tools.

**2024-present:** Early signs emerging. What are we seeing?
- Skill atrophy (people forgetting how to write, code, think without AI)
- Dependency on systems they don't understand
- Loss of craft satisfaction ("I used to enjoy writing, now it feels hollow")
- Anxiety about being replaced
- Difficulty distinguishing AI-generated from human-created

**Question:** What will we know in 2027? 2030? 2035?

The Amish would wait to find out. Are you?

*[Music transition]*

---

## ACT 4: THE MODIFICATION PRINCIPLE

*[Back to conversation]*

**ALEX:** Okay, I'm convinced waiting has value. But I can't just... not use AI for five years. I'll be left behind economically.

**ELDER:** Then modify. That's step four of our method. If you must adopt, modify to preserve what you value.

**JORDAN:** Like the phone shanties.

**ELDER:** Exactly. We needed phones for business. But we valued family dinners without interruption. Solution: phones in separate buildings. You can use them. But they can't interrupt family time.

**ALEX:** What would that look like for AI?

**ELDER:** I don't know your values. But here are questions:

If you value deep thinking—what boundaries prevent AI from atrophying that skill?

If you value craft—how do you use AI as assistant without replacing your own creativity?

If you value human relationships—where do you draw the line on AI-mediated connection?

If you value understanding your tools—what level of AI abstraction is too much?

**JORDAN:** These are really hard questions.

**ELDER:** Of course they are. That's why we discuss them collectively for years before deciding. You're trying to decide individually in real-time while adopting.

**ALEX:** So we should form... AI evaluation communities?

**ELDER:** *[laughs]* You should form communities, period. The evaluation is just one benefit.

*[Music: opening up]*

**NARRATOR:** Elder just pointed to something deeper than technology evaluation. The Amish method works because they have COMMUNITIES that can hold collective decision-making processes.

Most knowledge workers don't. We're isolated individuals making personal optimization decisions. "Should I use Claude or ChatGPT?" "Should I learn Cursor or Copilot?"

These are individual choices about tools. Not collective decisions about values.

The Amish method requires community infrastructure that most of us don't have.

Which means: to adopt the Amish method for AI, you first need to BUILD the communities that can practice it.

This is what we'll explore more in Rabbit Hole Three. But for now, let's complete this conversation.

## ACT 5: WHAT THE MAINSTREAM GETS WRONG

*[Coffee bar sounds, conversation winding down]*

**ALEX:** Last question. What do you think mainstream society gets most wrong about technology adoption?

**ELDER:** You think being first is winning.

**ALEX:** It's not?

**ELDER:** Being first means being the experiment. Being second—after watching what happens to the first—means learning from someone else's mistakes.

**JORDAN:** But in competitive markets, being second means losing market share.

**ELDER:** We're not trying to win markets. We're trying to maintain communities. Different goals, different strategies.

**ALEX:** So the mainstream goal—economic competition—drives the rush to adopt?

**ELDER:** Yes. And that's fine if that's what you value. But then don't complain when the adoption creates problems. You chose speed over wisdom.

**JORDAN:** What if you want both? Economic viability AND community maintenance?

**ELDER:** Then you need collective agreements. Rules about how to adopt. Boundaries that preserve what matters. This is what we've done for 200 years.

You can have markets. We have markets too. But we have markets within a framework that protects relationships.

You have markets with no framework. So the market eats everything, including relationships.

*[Long pause]*

**ALEX:** That's... sobering.

**ELDER:** It should be. You're watching AI disrupt everything and asking "how do I personally survive?" We're watching and asking "how do we collectively decide what to preserve?"

Very different questions.

*[Music: thoughtful, closing]*

## CLOSING: THE STRATEGIC PATIENCE

**NARRATOR:** Let me summarize what we just learned.

**The Amish Method has four steps:**

1. **Early adopters test** - Some community members try new technology
2. **Community discusses** - Everyone observes effects over years, not months
3. **Collective decision** - Congregational vote based on actual evidence
4. **Modification if adopted** - "Amish hacking" to preserve values

**The core question they ask:**  
Not "what does this let us do?"  
But "what does this do to how we relate?"

**The strategic insight:**  
Being "behind" isn't losing. It's gaining information. Mainstream society becomes free beta testers. The Amish avoid entire crises (teen depression, attention fragmentation, community dissolution) by watching what happens to early adopters first.

**The uncomfortable implication for AI:**  
We're rushing to adopt without knowing what AI does to:
- Our capacity for deep thinking
- Our relationship with craft
- Our human connections
- Our understanding of our tools
- Our agency and autonomy

The Amish would wait and watch. Are we?

**The modification principle:**  
If you must adopt early, create boundaries. Phone shanties for phones. What are the equivalent boundaries for AI?

**The prerequisite:**  
This only works if you know what you value. The Amish know: family, community, skilled work, face-to-face relationships. Do you?

**The collective requirement:**  
The Amish method requires communities that can hold collective decision-making. Most knowledge workers are isolated individuals. To use the Amish method, you first need to build the communities that can practice it.

Next episode, we'll explore the fourth element from Episode 1 in depth: boredom as infrastructure. Why unstructured time is necessary for pattern recognition, and why you can't optimize your way to discovery.

But first, sit with Elder's question:

*What does AI do to how you relate?*

Not to your productivity. Not to your income. Not to your efficiency.

To your relationships.

## SHOW NOTES

### Episode Summary
The Amish have navigated 200 years of technological disruption using a simple method: watch mainstream society adopt first, observe actual effects over years, then decide collectively whether to adopt (and how to modify). This episode explores what happens when you flip the script on disruption—when being "behind" is strategic, not primitive.

### Key Concepts
- **The 50-Year Test Cycle:** Using mainstream as beta testers
- **The Core Question:** "What does this do to how we relate?" (not "what can we do with it?")
- **The Four Steps:** Early adopters test → Community discusses → Collective decision → Modification if adopted
- **Amish Hacking:** Modifying technology to fit values (phone shanties, pneumatic tools, solar not grid)
- **The Strategic Patience:** Being "behind" as information gathering
- **The Teen Depression Case Study:** How the Amish avoided the social media mental health crisis
- **The Prerequisite:** Knowing what you value before you can evaluate technology
- **The Collective Requirement:** Need communities that can hold decision-making processes

### Questions to Sit With
1. What does AI do to how you relate? (Not to your productivity—to your relationships)
2. What do you actually value? (Can you name 3-5 things you're trying to protect?)
3. If you're adopting AI by default, what are you using as your evaluation criteria?
4. What would "AI phone shanties" look like for you? (Boundaries that let you use AI without it consuming everything)
5. Do you have a community that could practice collective technology evaluation? If not, how do you build one?
6. Are you trying to "win" (be first) or trying to maintain something valuable?

### The Amish Method Applied to AI (Worksheet)

**Step 1: What do you value?**
- List 3-5 things you're trying to protect (relationships, skills, ways of being)

**Step 2: What is AI doing to those things?**
- For each value, observe: is AI strengthening it or weakening it?
- Look for evidence over months/years, not days/weeks

**Step 3: What boundaries would preserve what you value?**
- Like phone shanties: where can you use AI, where must it be forbidden?
- Like pneumatic tools: what function is useful, what dependency is dangerous?

**Step 4: Who can you evaluate this with collectively?**
- 3-5 people navigating similar questions
- Monthly check-ins to share observations
- Collective decision-making about boundaries

### Credits & Acknowledgments
This episode draws heavily from ethnographic research on Amish communities, particularly the work of Donald Kraybill and Jameson Wetmore. "Elder" represents a composite voice synthesized from multiple sources, not a single individual.

The Amish method is presented as one approach to technology evaluation, not THE approach. Different communities will need different methods based on their values and constraints.

### Resources
- "The Amish" by Kraybill, Johnson-Weiner, and Nolt
- "Rethinking Technology: A Reader in Architectural Theory" (Leach, ed.) - includes Amish case studies
- "The Anxious Generation" by Jonathan Haidt
- Wetmore's papers on Amish technology adoption (available through ASU)

### Community Discussion Questions
If you're listening with a group:
1. What technology have you adopted that changed how you relate to people? (For better or worse?)
2. If you could go back and evaluate that technology collectively before adopting, what would you have decided?
3. What would a 50-year test cycle reveal about smartphones? Social media? AI?
4. What values would your community use to evaluate new technology?
5. What modifications (like phone shanties) would preserve what you value while still allowing useful function?
