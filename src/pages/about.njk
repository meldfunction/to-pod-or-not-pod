    <strong>Things Overheard at the Coffee Bar</strong> began the way many rabbit holes do:
    with a fragment of someone else's conversation that refused to leave our minds.
  </p>

  <p>
    What if we followed every curious thread? What if the snippets we overhear—about
    ancient rituals, obscure sciences, forgotten histories—were invitations to dig deeper?
  </p>

  <p>
    This nine-episode series is the result of that experiment. Each episode starts with
    something real: a phrase caught between the espresso machine's hiss and the morning
    rush. From there, we follow the rabbit hole wherever it leads.
  </p>

  <h2>The Format</h2>
  <p>
    Episodes range from 27 to 38 minutes. We've organized them into five "rabbit holes"—
    thematic clusters that emerged naturally as we explored. You can listen in order or
    jump to whatever catches your ear.
