# RABBIT HOLE TWO: EFFICIENCY & ABUNDANCE
## Episodes 4-6 Overview

**The Question:** What happens when AI makes knowledge work radically cheaper?

---

## THE PARADOX

Everyone assumes: AI makes knowledge work more efficient → we'll need fewer knowledge workers.

But history shows the opposite. Every time we've made something radically more efficient, total consumption has *increased*, not decreased.

**1865:** James Watt's steam engine was 8x more efficient than previous models. Coal consumption dropped, right? 

Wrong. It rose 18x.

This is **Jevons Paradox**: When you make something dramatically more efficient, you reveal latent demand that was suppressed by cost. Total consumption explodes.

And it's coming to knowledge work.

---

## THE MECHANICS

**Three rebound mechanisms:**

**Direct rebound:** AI makes writing cheaper → you write more reports, create more content, generate more analysis. Studies show this accounts for 10-30% increase.

**Indirect rebound:** Money/time saved on writing gets spent on other knowledge work—presentations, research, strategy. You didn't write more, but you increased total knowledge work anyway.

**Economy-wide rebound:** Cheaper knowledge work makes entire economy more productive, increasing GDP, which increases demand for knowledge work across all sectors. This is invisible but massive.

**The pattern:** Each 1% efficiency gain coincides with 0.7% net increase in consumption. We're not saving energy by making computers more efficient—we invented streaming video, cryptocurrency mining, and AI training, which consume *vastly* more energy than less-efficient computers ever did.

## THE 100X PATTERN

This isn't theoretical. It's happened five times in computing history, each wave roughly 100x larger than the last:

**Wave 1 - Mainframes (1970s):**
- 7,300 units sold (1979)
- $1M+ each
- Only Fortune 500 could afford
- Enabled: batch processing, corporate accounting

**Wave 2 - Minicomputers (1970s-80s):**
- 81,300 units sold (1979) 
- $18K-$100K each
- Departments could afford
- Enabled: real-time process control, scientific computing

**Wave 3 - PCs (1980s-90s):**
- Millions sold
- $2K-$10K each
- Individuals could afford
- Enabled: personal productivity, desktop publishing

**Wave 4 - Cloud/SaaS (2000s-2010s):**
- Billions of users
- $50-$500/month
- Any business could afford
- Enabled: sophisticated tools for barbershops and plumbers

**Wave 5 - AI Agents (2020s-?):**
- Pennies per task
- Anyone with API access
- Enables: Fortune 500 capabilities for 10-person companies

**The pattern:** Each wave democratizes access by 100x, which reveals needs that couldn't exist at previous price points. The barbershop owner in 1970 didn't *know* they needed accounting software because it was economically impossible. Once possible, the need became visible.

## TODAY'S JOBS BECOME TOMORROW'S TASKS

**Historical example: Marketing**

1970s: Few hundred thousand marketing jobs in the US. Manual typesetting, hand-drawn illustrations, print-only advertising. Cost per campaign: $50K-$500K. Only large companies could afford.

Today: Low millions employed in marketing. Digital tools made individual tasks 100x more efficient. Did this eliminate marketing jobs?

No. It *expanded* who could afford marketing. Every small business now justifies a marketing budget. Every niche product can find its audience.

**We made marketing more efficient and increased marketing employment 5x.**

**The pattern repeats:**
- "Graphic designer" (1970s job) → "design this ad" (today's task within marketing role)
- "Data entry clerk" (1980s job) → "upload this spreadsheet" (today's task within analyst role)
- "Junior programmer" (2020s job) → "implement this feature" (2030s task within product role?)

The *work* doesn't disappear. It becomes a component of larger roles. And total work expands because it's now accessible to 100x more organizations.

## THE INVESTMENT COST EQUATION

"The mistake people make when thinking about ROI is making the 'R' the core variable, when the real point of leverage is bringing down the cost of 'I'." —Aaron Levie

Traditional thinking: maximize return. Better marketing, better sales, better features.

But the actual constraint isn't return—it's **investment cost**.

**AI collapses three costs:**
1. **Expertise acquisition:** No hiring, training, onboarding ($100K+ saved)
2. **Execution cost:** Pennies per task vs. dollars per hour
3. **Risk cost:** Iterate quickly, fail cheap, pivot easily

**Example:** Customer dashboard
- Human: $100K investment, 6 months, high risk
- AI-assisted: $6K investment, 3 weeks, low risk

That's 15x reduction in cost of "I". When investment drops 15x, what becomes viable?

*Everything you weren't doing because it had negative ROI at old costs.*

## WHAT BECOMES SCARCE WHEN INTELLIGENCE OVERFLOWS

When intelligence becomes abundant, scarcity shifts. **Four candidates for what becomes valuable:**

**1. Wisdom** - Judging what matters, not just solving problems. AI can optimize within constraints; it can't question the constraints. "How do I grow my business?" vs. "Should I grow my business?"

**2. Context** - Deep understanding of specific situations. Most business context is unspoken, unconscious, relational, emotional. AI gets explicit context. It misses the 80% you don't know to mention.

**3. Relationships** - Trust built over time. Mutual vulnerability, mutual stakes, mutual becoming. AI can simulate friendship but can't experience it. No skin in the game.

**4. Embodiment** - Physical presence, somatic intelligence, felt sense. The ER doctor who "just knows" something's wrong. The caregiver who shows up. Presence that can't be replicated.

**These four converge:** They all require participation. They can't be extracted, scaled, or automated. They only exist in the doing.

---

## THE SHIFT

**From task-based to relationship-based value:**

**Task-based:** "I'll design your logo for $5K"
- Value is the deliverable
- Can serve 50 clients
- Extractable, replicable
- AI can compete

**Relationship-based:** "I'll be your design partner for $25K/year"
- Value is accumulated context and trust
- Can serve 10 clients
- Non-transferable, specific
- AI can assist but not replace

Same revenue. Different economic model. Different resilience to AI disruption.

---

## WHAT TO DO MONDAY

**Audit your value:**
For each client/project, ask:
- What do they actually value beyond the deliverable?
- What relationship knowledge have I built over time?
- Could they get the same value from AI, or does it require me specifically?

**If task-based:** Can you shift toward relationship-based? Add context, wisdom, embodiment that AI can't replicate?

**If relationship-based:** Double down. Build deeper client relationships. Become irreplaceable through specificity, not generalizability.

**The strategic question:** Not "can AI do my tasks?" but "does my value exist in tasks or relationships?"

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

The "AI will eliminate jobs" narrative misses the pattern. AI doesn't eliminate jobs—it democratizes access, which reveals latent demand, which expands total work.

But the *nature* of work shifts. From individual expertise to collective capacity. From deliverables to relationships. From extraction to participation.

The question isn't whether work exists. It's **who captures it** and **what kind of value they create**.

Those building relationship-based, participatory value are positioning for abundance. Those relying on extractive, task-based value are competing with AI.
