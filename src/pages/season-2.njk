  <section class="season-intro">
    <p>Not the hushed reverence of libraries. Not the performative discourse of conference halls. Something in between—where a therapist asks "Where do you feel that in your body?" and the answer is "My cells feel green and electric." Where someone DJs a wedding and discovers that a single word contains an entire world. Where a half-birthday becomes a threshold, and dissonance becomes information instead of failure.</p>

    <p>Season Two emerged from a single conversation between Rachel (a neurodiversity specialist in Wisconsin) and BK (preparing for his third pilgrimage to India). They met at a warm data training in Berkeley, stayed in touch, and one afternoon decided to record what happened when they talked.</p>

    <p>What emerged wasn't an interview. It was a mutual discovery process—two people thinking out loud about how you actually learn when nobody taught you how, how you love yourself by paying attention, and why the most solid foundations need to be the most flexible.</p>

  <section class="rabbit-holes-intro">
    <h2>The Three Rabbit Holes</h2>
    <p>We started noticing patterns. Three rabbit holes that kept appearing in different forms:</p>

    <p><strong>First</strong>: How do you learn your own way of learning? Not "find the right teacher" learning, but discovering your own epistemology—the way YOU process information, the way YOUR body holds wisdom, the path that works for you even when it doesn't work for anyone else.</p>

    <p><strong>Second</strong>: What happens when you turn that discovery process onto yourself? When you learn to observe yourself without immediately judging, fixing, or changing? When attention becomes love?</p>

    <p><strong>Third</strong>: How do you navigate the spaces between harmony and dissonance? When things don't resolve neatly? When you need to hold tension without forcing resolution? When the foundation itself needs flexibility?</p>

    <h2>Rabbit Hole One: Personal Epistemology</h2>
    <p class="rabbit-hole-question"><em>How do you know what you know?</em></p>

    <p><strong>The Central Question:</strong> Why do some of us have to unlearn how to learn before we can actually learn anything?</p>

    <p>For people whose nervous systems don't match the standard educational model—neurodivergent people, embodied learners, those who need to discover rather than be taught—the question "How do I learn?" becomes existential.</p>

    <h2>Rabbit Hole Two: Meta-Awareness as Practice</h2>
    <p class="rabbit-hole-question"><em>What happens when you learn to watch yourself without fixing yourself?</em></p>

    <p><strong>The Central Question:</strong> What if the way you pay attention to yourself is how you love yourself?</p>

    <p>For people who've been locked out of their own bodies—through trauma, neurodivergence, cultural conditioning, or the simple fact that the standard somatic practices don't work—the question "How do I access my body?" becomes urgent.</p>

    <h2>Rabbit Hole Three: Navigating Harmony & Dissonance</h2>
    <p class="rabbit-hole-question"><em>How do we move between states without needing perfect pitch?</em></p>

    <p><strong>The Central Question:</strong> What if the most solid foundations need to be the most flexible?</p>

    <p>Miles Davis: "It's the note AFTER the dissonant note that matters." Music physics: lower notes have more relativity, higher notes have less room for interpretation.</p>

  <section class="season-themes">
    <h2>Themes Across the Season</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> Inner and outer. Self and other. Harmony and dissonance. The constant dance between polarities.</li>
      <li><strong>Discovery vs. Instruction:</strong> Framing learning, healing, growth as discovery-centered rather than instruction-centered.</li>
      <li><strong>Observation as Love:</strong> The quality of attention you bring to yourself and others is how you love.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility in Foundations:</strong> The more fundamental something is, the more relativity it needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Both/And:</strong> You can dance AND harmonize. Hold dissonance AND find beauty. The false binary is the problem.</li>
    </ul>
