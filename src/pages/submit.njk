  </header>

  <p>
    The conversation between Rachel and BK is one example. But the coffee bar has thousands
    of conversations happening every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    What are YOU discovering? What's coalescing in your life? What inflection point are you standing at?
  </p>

  <p>
    We're collecting voice memos of moments when you noticed something. When a conversation
    at a coffee shop (or anywhere) revealed something you weren't looking for.
  </p>

  <h2>What We're Looking For</h2>

  <div class="submit-guidelines">
    <h3>Recording Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Real conversations</strong> (not staged or scripted)</li>
      <li><strong>3-10 minutes long</strong> (quality over quantity)</li>
      <li><strong>Clear audio</strong> (phone recording is fine, just minimize background noise)</li>
      <li><strong>Permission from everyone</strong> in the recording</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="submit-guidelines">
    <h3>Content Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A conversation that changed how you see something</li>
      <li>An overheard fragment that sent you down a rabbit hole</li>
      <li>A moment of discovery you want to share</li>
      <li>Your reflection on something you learned (30 seconds to 3 minutes)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>How to Submit</h2>

  <p>
    Record your voice memo and send it to us. Include a brief description of the context:
    where you were, what prompted the conversation, and what you discovered.
  </p>

  <div class="submit-email">
    <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Voice%20Memo%20Submission">{{ site.email }}</a>
  </div>

  <p>
    Some submissions might become episodes. All of them contribute to the larger conversation
    about how we actually learn, grow, and transform.
  </p>

  <h2>What Happens Next</h2>

  <p>
    We listen to every submission. If your voice memo resonates with themes we're exploring,
    we may reach out to discuss featuring it in a future episode. Either way, you're part of
    the conversation now.
  </p>

  <p>
    The coffee bar is still open. We're listening.
