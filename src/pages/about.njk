    <strong>Things Overheard at the Coffee Bar</strong> began the way many rabbit holes do:
    with a fragment of someone else's conversation that refused to leave our minds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not the hushed reverence of libraries. Not the performative discourse of conference halls.
    Something in between—where a graduate student explaining neural plasticity sits three feet
    from a parent troubleshooting their kid's screen addiction. Where someone codes an AI sorting
    algorithm while overhearing a debate about whether recycling actually works.
  </p>

  <p>
    The coffee bar operates as what sociologist Ray Oldenburg called a "third place"—neither
    home nor work, but the informal public gathering space where community happens accidentally.
    In an era of algorithmic feeds and curated social media, the coffee bar remains defiantly
    analog: you can't control who sits next to you, can't mute conversations you disagree with,
    can't fast-forward through the boring parts.
  </p>

  <p>This friction, it turns out, might be exactly what we need.</p>

  <h2>The Format</h2>
  <p>We don't do interviews. We don't do news. We don't do self-help.</p>

  <p>
    We follow conversations down rabbit holes—following a question until you hit something real.
    Something that matters. Something that doesn't have a quick answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Why three rabbit holes?</strong> Because complexity emerges in threes. One episode
    gives you a perspective. Two episodes create tension. Three episodes—if you structure them
    right—create a SYSTEM. A way of seeing.
  </p>

  <p>Each rabbit hole follows the same arc:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Deep research or discovery</li>
    <li>Where it breaks or what doesn't work</li>
    <li>What actually works</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This isn't "problem &rarr; solution." It's "question &rarr; navigation &rarr; learning."</p>
